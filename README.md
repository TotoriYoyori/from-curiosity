Welcome to the realm of molecular mastery in From Curiosity! Dive into a unique fusion of word puzzle mechanics and alchemical wonders where your linguistic skills meet your chemical expertise. Become the master of elements as you concoct powerful molecules to combat fearsome monsters in an epic journey through a dead world, where chemistry is its only salvation. 

As an aspiring chemist, you wield the power to combine elements not just to create compounds but to vanquish adversaries. Unlike traditional word puzzles, From Curiosity challenges you to assemble molecules instead of words, each combination unlocking potent effects to aid you in combat. 

# Planned Features
(The following list will be updated as the developers learn more about the game and what makes it fun!)

### Molecules Mastery
Utilize your knowledge of chemistry to combine elements and craft intricate molecules. From simple compounds to complex structures, every creation holds the key to victory.

### Strategic Turn-based Combat
Engage in tactical battles against a variety of monstrous foes. Plan your synthesis wisely to defeat enemies and progress through the game. A well-timed corrosive acid can weaken your enemy's ultimate attack, or a stalwart salt block can protect you from harms. It is all trials and errors with From Curiosity! 

### Dynamic Effects and Combos
Experiment with diverse combinations of catalysts to unleash a multitude of effects. From elemental blasts using combustion to protective barriers using electrolysis, your strategic choices in crafting will determine the outcome of each encounter.

### Rich Alchemical World
Explore a dull and lifeless world filled with eldricht landscapes and ancient ruins. In this world, mastery over chemistry is the only way to survival, and eventually save it from its lifelessness. 

# Turn-based combat loops
### 1. Elements spawn on the battle
Every turn, a random amount of interactable elements (Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, etc.) will spawn on game scene that the players can interact with to add to a crafting system. 

### 2. Craft molecules for your turn
During the player's turn, they can experiment and craft any molecules that are accepted by the game's algorithms. The game will check for valid/invalid molecules. If the molecule is valid, the players may attack and end their turn.

### 3. Enemy's turn begins
During the enemy's turn, they will deal a variety of effects against the players. 

### 4. Consumed elements get refreshed
The elements that were consumed on the player's previous turn for synthesis will be refreshed. Return to step 2, and continue the turn-based game loops until either the player or the monster is defeated.
